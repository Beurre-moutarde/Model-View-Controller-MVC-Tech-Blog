## Description

This is an app for a MVC Tech Blog that provides RESTful APIs for managing blog posts, comments, and users. The back-end is built using Node.js web application framework and Sequelize ORM. It allows you to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts, comments, and users. The data is stored in a MySQL database management system. The back-end also includes authentication and authorization functionalities for users.
